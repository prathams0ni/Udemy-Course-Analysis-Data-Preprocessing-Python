    "\n",
    "## 📌 Project Overview\n",
    "Udemy is one of the largest online learning platforms, offering thousands of courses across categories such as Business, Technology, Music, Health, and more.  \n",
    "With millions of learners worldwide, understanding what makes a course successful is essential for instructors and platforms alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on performing **end-to-end Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Udemy’s course dataset to uncover insights related to pricing, enrollments, content structure, and learner behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 Problem Statement\n",
    "With the rapid growth of online education, not all courses perform equally in terms of enrollments and engagement.  \n",
    "The challenge is to identify:\n",
    "- What factors contribute to higher enrollments\n",
    "- How pricing, duration, and course structure influence learner behavior\n",
    "- Differences between free and paid courses\n",
    "- Patterns across course levels and categories\n",

    "## 🧹 Importance of Data Preprocessing\n",
    "Raw real-world data is often incomplete, inconsistent, and noisy.  \n",
    "Proper data preprocessing ensures:\n",
    "- Accurate and reliable analysis\n",
    "- Removal of noise and irrelevant information\n",
    "- Consistent data formats\n",
    "- Readiness for modeling or advanced analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "Data preprocessing forms the foundation of any successful data science project.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 Data Preprocessing Steps Performed\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ Data Inspection\n",
    "- Checked dataset shape, structure, and data types\n",
    "- Reviewed summary statistics to understand distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning\n",
    "- Removed duplicate records\n",
    "- Corrected inconsistent values\n",
    "- Standardized categorical variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ Handling Missing Values\n",
    "- Identified missing and null values\n",
    "- Removed or handled missing data based on relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ Data Transformation\n",
    "- Encoded categorical variables for analysis\n",
    "- Created derived features such as **price bands**\n",
    "- Converted columns into appropriate data types\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5️⃣ Handling Outliers\n",
    "- Identified extreme values in pricing and enrollments\n",
    "- Analyzed their impact instead of blindly removing them\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6️⃣ Feature Engineering\n",
    "- Created aggregated and grouped features\n",
    "- Improved data usability for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Strategy\n",
    "EDA was conducted to visually and statistically explore relationships between variables, focusing on:\n",
    "- Price vs enrollments\n",
    "- Free vs paid course performance\n",
    "- Course level and engagement\n",
    "- Content duration and lecture count impact\n",
    "- Category-wise enrollment trends\n",
    "- Detection of patterns, trends, and anomalies\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizations were created using charts and plots to support insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ❓ Key Business Questions Addressed\n",
    "- Which course categories attract the highest enrollments?\n",
    "- Do lower-priced courses consistently outperform expensive ones?\n",
    "- How does course level (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert) affect engagement?\n",
    "- Is longer content always better for enrollments?\n",
    "- Which pricing ranges show optimal median enrollments?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Insights Interpretation\n",
    "Key insights from the analysis indicate that:\n",
    "- Learners prefer affordable or free courses\n",
    "- Beginner-level courses tend to attract more subscribers\n",
    "- Course structure influences engagement, but quality matters equally\n",
    "- Strategic pricing aligned with learner expectations improves enrollments\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used\n",
    "- **Python**\n",
    "- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation\n",
    "- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization\n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Assumptions & Limitations\n",
    "**Assumptions:**\n",
    "- The dataset accurately represents Udemy course trends\n",
    "- Enrollment count reflects learner interest\n",
    "\n",
